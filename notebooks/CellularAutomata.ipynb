    "# Introduction to Cellular Automata with Python\n",
    "Cellular automata (CA) are mathematical models used to simulate complex systems using simple, discrete rules on a grid of cells. Each cell in a grid can be in one of several possible states (e.g., alive or dead) and interacts with its neighboring cells to determine its next state. Cellular automata are useful in modeling phenomena like patterns in nature, biological systems, and artificial life."
