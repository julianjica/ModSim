    "The t-value measures how many standard deviations the coefficient estimate is from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation:**\n",
    "  - Larger absolute t-values suggest the predictor is more significant.\n",
    "  - Rule of thumb: |t| > 2 is often considered statistically significant (for large samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If a predictor has a t-value of 3.5, its coefficient is 3.5 standard deviations away from 0, suggesting it's likely significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## p-values (model.pvalues)\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is the probability of observing a t-value as extreme as the calculated one, assuming the null hypothesis (β = 0) is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation:**\n",
    "  - Typically compared to a significance level (α), often 0.05.\n",
    "  - If p < α, we reject the null hypothesis and consider the predictor significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If a predictor has a p-value of 0.02, there's a 2% chance of observing this result if the true coefficient were 0. This would be considered significant at the 0.05 level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence Intervals (model.conf_int())\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a range of plausible values for each coefficient, typically at the 95% confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation:**\n",
    "  - If the interval doesn't include 0, the predictor is considered significant at that confidence level.\n",
    "  - Wider intervals indicate less precision in the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If a coefficient's 95% CI is [0.5, 1.5], we can say we're 95% confident the true coefficient lies between 0.5 and 1.5. Since 0 isn't in this interval, it's significant at the 5% level.\n",
